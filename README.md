# QuantLLM

**Quantization Kernel Library for LLM Inference**

QuantLLM is a high-performance library designed to accelerate large language model (LLM) inference through the use of quantization techniques. Built on top of Cutlass, this library provides optimized quantization kernels that significantly reduce memory usage and computational costs without sacrificing model accuracy.

## Features

- **Efficient Quantization**: Implements state-of-the-art quantization algorithms to minimize model size and enhance inference speed.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for GPU acceleration with Cutlass, ensuring that the quantized kernels are fast and scalable.
- **Support for LLM Inference**: Tailored specifically for large language models, enabling efficient inference on large-scale tasks.
